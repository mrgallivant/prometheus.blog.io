# About Me
I'm a medical student at the UZH (University of Zurich). My brother introduced me to the idea of writing a blog. I thought this kind of "journal" might help me to become more consistent and bring in some variety in my studies. Furthermore, I wan't to improve my writing skills and become more creative in my thinking.

Thusly, my resolution for 2019 is to write an entry about a medical topic every week.
